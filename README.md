# Hi, I'm Pinar Carkci

I am a 24 years old second-year software developer student at TER AA Helmond.  
Through my studies I’ve gained experience with **HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, C++ (Arduino), and C# (WinForms)**.  
Lately I’ve also been learning **JavaScript** to expand my skills.  

I enjoy trying out different kinds of projects — from web development to embedded systems — to see where I can grow the most.
